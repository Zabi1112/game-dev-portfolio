        Hello everyone! Iâ€™m <span className="purple">Zabi Ullah Warraich</span> from <span className="purple">Pakistan</span>.
        <br />
        <br />
        I am currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at CLV Technologies and Salvay, with over <strong>5 years of professional experience</strong> in the gaming industry.
        <br />
        <br />
        My core expertise lies in <strong>game development</strong> using <strong>Unity</strong> and <strong>C#</strong>, with a strong focus on creating dynamic multiplayer experiences. 
        Alongside Unity, I also have <strong>hands-on experience with Unreal Engine</strong>, having built prototypes for client projects.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition to game development, I am skilled in <strong>backend development</strong> using <strong>Node.js</strong>, enabling me to create complete and scalable multiplayer infrastructures.
        <br />
        <br />
        I am passionate about crafting high-quality, innovative gaming solutions that blend creativity with technology.
